![PyDskChk Command Line](http://cl.ly/5kVx)

PyDskChk is a simple python disk checking system to email you when disks or folders become unavailable. It was developed by [Andrei Zbikowski](http://az.wbbmx.org/) and was written to help manage large raid disk drives. It's free and open source, and probably 10x worse then any other disk checking system.
